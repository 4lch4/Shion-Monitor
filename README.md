# Shion Monitor

This directory is home to the Monitor component of project Shion, which is responsible for monitoring my activities on my desktop and sending it over to the API component.

## Notes

- I'm definitely gonna need to "buffer" requests to the API.
  - I realized if I send a request every time I hold down a key or something it'll _spam_ the fuck out of the API.
